/**
 * Inline text input shown after the user picks Approve or Refine in
 * PlanConfirm. Collects free-form feedback before the loop resumes.
 *
 * Why both paths: the plan may contain open questions or risks the
 * model asked the user to weigh in on. If the user just picks Approve
 * with no chance to answer, the model implements against its own
 * guesses. This input lets the user answer questions, pass last-minute
 * constraints, or (on Refine) request concrete changes. Empty input is
 * fine for Approve (skip straight to implement) and triggers a
 * "ask the user clarifying questions" path for Refine.
 *
 * Kept minimal: single-line prompt, Enter to submit, Esc to return to
 * the picker without resuming.
