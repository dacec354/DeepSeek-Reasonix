/**
 * Plan Mode — read-only exploration phase for `reasonix code`.
 *
 * Shape (mirrors claude-code's plan/act split, adapted for Reasonix):
 *
 *   1. User types `/plan` → registry switches to plan-mode enforcement
 *      (write tools refused at dispatch; reads + allowlisted shell
 *      still work).
 *   2. Model explores, then calls `submit_plan` with a markdown plan
 *      (and, optionally, a structured `steps` array).
 *   3. `submit_plan` throws `PlanProposedError`, which the TUI renders
 *      as a picker: Approve / Refine / Cancel.
 *   4. Approve → registry leaves plan mode, a synthetic user message
 *      "The plan has been approved. Implement it now." is pushed into
 *      the loop so the next turn executes.
 *   5. During execution the model may call `mark_step_complete` after
 *      each step; the TUI shows a progress row per completion.
 *
 * The read-only enforcement lives in `ToolRegistry.dispatch` via
 * `readOnly` / `readOnlyCheck`; this file ships the `submit_plan`
 * escape hatch, the `mark_step_complete` progress signal, and the
 * error type that carries the plan out of the registry without
 * stuffing it into the message.
 *
 * We do not change `ImmutablePrefix.toolSpecs` when plan mode toggles —
 * that would break Pillar 1's prefix cache. Instead the same full spec
 * list stays pinned, and the registry enforces mode at dispatch time.
 * The refusal string teaches the model the rule; cache hits stay
 * intact.
